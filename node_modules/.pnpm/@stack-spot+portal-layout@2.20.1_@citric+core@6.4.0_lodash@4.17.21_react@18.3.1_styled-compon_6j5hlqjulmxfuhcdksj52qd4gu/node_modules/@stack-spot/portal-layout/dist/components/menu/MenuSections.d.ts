 * Renders a menu-sections interface.
 *
 * Considering the Stackspot UI, this is the "menu sections", not the "menu content", i.e. it's the first menu from left to right, the
 * one with the icons and section names: the main menu.
 *
 * Attention: each section in the menu is identified by its index. To avoid errors, the array passed to this component must never change.
 * To control whether or not to show an item, use the property `hidden`, instead of adding/removing it to the array. Example of error:
 * start the section menu with 5 items, remove the 5th item and add another item. The previous 5th item and the new 5th items are different,
 * but since we identify the item by its index, the two different sections will be rendered as if they were the same, causing a react hook
 * call order problem.
 *
 * @param props the props for the component {@link MenuProps}.
