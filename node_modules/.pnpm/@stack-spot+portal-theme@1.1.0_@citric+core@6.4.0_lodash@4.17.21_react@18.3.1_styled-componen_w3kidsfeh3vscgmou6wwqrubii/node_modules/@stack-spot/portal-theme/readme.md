# Theme
This library contains the StackSpot theme (css) and many utilities to use and manipulate it.

Attention: this is not Citric, our design system (DS), instead, it's a configuration that we pass to it.

Platforms: this library is compatible with the web (browser) and VSCode (used by the StackSpot AI extension).

## Incomplete set of tokens
This library is mostly dealing with colors. The rest of the theme is still defined by Citric. This will be reviewed in a future version, along with Citric itself.

## Using the theme

1. Import the css into your main project file:
```ts
import '@stack-spot/portal-theme/dist/theme.css'
```
2. Setup the theme provider for Citric.
```tsx
import { CSSToCitricAdapter } '@stack-spot/portal-theme'

const App = () => (
  <CSSToCitricAdapter>
    // Your content goes here. Every component of Citric will be aware of the theme from this point on.
  </CSSToCitricAdapter>
)
```
3. You can now use the theme in your jsx to define colors:
```tsx
<p style={{ color: theme.color.primary['500'] }}>Hello World!</p>
```
4. You can also use the css variables defined by the theme in your css files:
```css
.my-class {
  background-color: var(--light-400);
}
```

## Reading and changing the current theme
- `getThemeName()`: gets the current theme name.
- `getThemeKind()`: returns "dark" if the theme is mostly dark or "light" if the theme is mostly light. This can be different than the theme name.
- `useThemeName()`: a React Hook to get the current theme name. Use this if you need your content to update when the theme changes.
- `useThemeKind()`: a React Hook to get the current theme kind. Use this if you need your content to update when the theme changes.
- `loadTheme()`: loads the theme from the cookie "theme".
- `setTheme(themeName)`: changes the current theme.

Observations:
- The default theme is "dark".
- The theme is always defined by the attributes `data-theme-name` and `data-theme-kind` on the tag `body`.
- The theme automatically updates across multiple windows.

## Utilities
- `withOpacity(variableName)`: applies an opacity to a theme css color variable.
- `contrastColor(color, level)`: gets the ideal contrast color for the color passed as parameter.
- `createColorSequence(options)`: generates a pre-defined, cyclic, set of ideally spread colors from the theme palette.
- `paletteSequence(options)`: same as `createColorSequence`, but generates the css variable instead.
- `valueOf(variableName)`: gets the value of a CSS variable.
- `listToClass(classList)`: removes all falsy values from the array and joins every item into a valid class string.
